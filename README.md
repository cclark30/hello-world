## Description
Hello, my name is Cameron. I'm a junior studying finance and business analytics at the University of Iowa. When I entered the university, I know I cared about people and energy sector. As my years progressed, I studied abroad and became obsessed with wealth management and the energy sector. I've studied in areas where group projects are the overwhelming majority of assignments. I took charge in groups and learned that I enjoy taking on a more organizational role within groups. I created products and solutions case studies given to me in schol and within my work experience.
